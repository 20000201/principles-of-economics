## Grade Contracts

You are allowed to form contracts with each other using your exam scores as the reference entity and [J-points]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Final_Grade_Calculation.pdf) as the currency. Examples include insurance contracts in which one student provides insurance to another for her exam performance.

In addition to private contracting, there are a number of "official" products that you can purchase. For details as well as examples of contracts that you can write, see: [Grade Contracts]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Grade_Contracts.pdf).

## Homework Allowance

Each student is is allowed to have the score of one of his or her homework assignments not count toward the final grade. This is called a **homework allowance**.

Homework allowances can be traded. You can buy and sell allowances with each other -- as well as derivates based on them -- using [J-points]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Lectures/Final_Grade_Calculation.pdf) as the currency. For details, see [Homework Allowance]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Homework_Allowance.pdf).
